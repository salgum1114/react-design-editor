# React Design Editor
- React Design Editor has started to develope Direct Manipulation of Editable Design Tools like Powerpoint, We've developed it with react.js, ant.design, fabric.js

- React Design Eidtor used fabric.js, because the main container starts with the canvas.

- Layouts and components such as property edits, item lists, toolbars were developed as react.js and the ant.design component was primarily used.

- The project is constantly being developed to support a variety of functions, and its goal is to be able to draw workflow (BPMN) in the future.
